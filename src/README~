Task : Hello World implementation
Due Date: 8/1/2016


------------------------------
Installation under Ubuntu 15.10

LLVM 3.6 is the default under 15.10, so we ask for a matching version of the
OCaml library.

sudo apt-get install -y ocaml m4 llvm opam
opam init
opam install llvm.3.6 ocamlfind
eval `opam config env`


------------------------------

Commands for testing hello-world:

make clean
make liva
./liva <test-hello.liva> test-hello.ll

lli test-hello.ll (it will show lli test-hello.ll. this is because functions are not declared yet!!!)


------------------------------
This source code is cloned and modified from microC project and Dice project 

1. For Dice Project, it uses Sast in Codegen, but in this file, it uses Ast, we could modify it to Sast once we figured out how to do this!

2. Currently, only the class clarification and definition are done for the macro test.

3. We need to implement the functions clarification, definitions, and built-in print function implementation at least to complete the Hello-World deliverable

4. Semantic analysis is blank for the current stage; we need to finish it once we completed the hello-world Codegen file.  

5. We need to polish the languages as much as possible.

6. Please fee free to modify the files to improve it better.

7. Need to set up a meeting on Monday to discuss each one's role on Codegen accomplishment.
