Task : Hello World implementation
Due Date: 8/1/2016


------------------------------
Installation under Ubuntu 15.10

LLVM 3.6 is the default under 15.10, so we ask for a matching version of the
OCaml library.

sudo apt-get install -y ocaml m4 llvm opam
opam init
opam install llvm.3.6 ocamlfind
eval `opam config env`


------------------------------

Commands for testing hello-world:

make clean
make liva
./liva <test-hello.liva> test-hello.ll

lli test-hello.ll (it will show 'main' function not found in module. This is because functions are not declared yet!!!)


------------------------------

The compiler structure is largely based on the Dice and MicroC compilers as they both provided excellent examples of how to use the llvm ocaml bindings. 

1. For Dice Project, it uses Sast in Codegen, but in this file, it uses Ast, we could modify it to Sast once we figure out how to do this!

2. Currently, only the class clarification and definition are done for the macro test.

3. We need to implement the functions clarification, definitions, and built-in print function implementation at least to complete the Hello-World deliverable

4. Semantic analysis is blank for the current stage; we need to finish it once we complete the hello-world Codegen file.  

5. We need to polish the languages as much as possible.

6. Please feel free to modify the files to improve it better.

7. Need to set up a meeting on Monday (7/25/2016) to discuss each one's role on Codegen accomplishment.

Updates after 7/25/2016 meeting

1. After discussion, we decided to implement the "Main" function first.

2. In order to implement the "Main" function, we need to introduce the semantic analysis to convert the AST to SAST. 

3. Sub-tasks are semantic analysis to convert the AST to SAST*, main function implementation*, buit-in print function, expression implementation (function call), and statement implementation. 

* IMPORTANT TASKS
